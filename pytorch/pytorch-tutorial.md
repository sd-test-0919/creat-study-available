- Dataset stores the samples and their corresponding label
- PyTorch offers domain-specific libraries such as TorchText, TorchVision, and TorchAudio
torch.utils.data.DataLoader 
- DataLoader wraps an iterable around the Dataset
- This wraps an iterable over our dataset, and supports automatic batching, sampling, shuffling and multiprocess data loading.
